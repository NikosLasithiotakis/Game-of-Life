## **Game of Life with OpenMP**

**This project implements Conway's Game of Life using OpenMP for parallel processing. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells that evolve through generations based on a set of rules. This implementation reads the initial state from a file, processes a specified number of generations using multiple threads, and outputs the final state to a file.**
